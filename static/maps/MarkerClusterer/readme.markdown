About
-----

At [Plank Design](http://www.plankdesign.com), we needed to use the MarkerClusterer for a [project](http://www.culturedays.ca).

We needed some added functionality: The ability to have a Cluster display all the info for the Markers in that Cluster. This allowed us to display all the information for events happening at one location. 

This modification plays nice with the Zoom On Click functionality already built in to MarkerClusterer.

We are putting it up here in the hopes it can help people, and we'll ping the MarkerClusterer maintainers to allow them to add the code to the official codebase if they so desire, so you might want to check there first before using our fork.
